# GraphVisualizer

This project helped reinforce my understanding of graphs by letting me build, visualize, and traverse them interactively. I implemented both DFS and BFS and provided visual feedback through node highlighting. It taught me how to balance logic-heavy algorithms with user-friendly design and handle real-time input updates within a graphical environment.
